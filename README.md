# Draft SKA Documentation

This is a beta version of the SKA Documents Hub.
The Documents Hub is intended to be a fully searchable documentation repository that hosts the relevant governing documents of the SKA in an accessible format.

The version of documents hosted here are drafts, and will not be considered binding until formally adopted by the SKA governing bodies.
After they have been formally adopted, the documents will be moved to a final documents hub.
