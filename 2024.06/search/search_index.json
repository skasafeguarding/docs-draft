However, the SKA recognises that there are complexities within existing safeguarding legislation regarding standards of conduct where a person under the age of 18 is involved in a position of leadership or authority within a sport. Because this, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to safeguarding, and as such the SKA would need to adopt a careful and considered approach that takes the specifics of individual circumstances into consideration.</p> <p>Where there is a participant under the age of 18 involved within Scottish korfball in any capacity other than as a player, such as in coaching, officiating, or otherwise volunteering or being part of a committee, the SKA will approach this on a case-by-case basis. Relevant officers of the SKA will work with the participant as well as a designated responsible adult to draft a code of conduct specific to the individual, their role, and circumstances. In doing so, the SKA will pay close attention to safeguarding risks that may arise as a result of conflicts of interest in the young participant\u2019s involvement, as well as any positions of power that can affect their relationships with their peers.</p> <ol> <li> <p>This rights-based approach is consistent with good practice established by other sport governing bodies, such as UK Athlethcs and Scottish Swimming.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"codes/changelog/","title":"Changelog","text":"<p>Following extensive consultation with member clubs of the SKA, the following changes and updates were made to the draft in response to the feedback received:</p> <ol> <li>Removed references to the right to privacy in the codes for players:     This is covered under data protection already and does not need to be a safeguarding code of conduct issue.</li> <li>Removed clause in player codes of conduct regarding commitment to training:     This was taken from a template of an SGB for a sport that had a much higher level of competition, and could be too demanding a clause for recreational players in the SKA.</li> <li>Removed references to \u2018friendly\u2019 and \u2018courteous\u2019 in conduct expectations, and changed it to \u2018respectful\u2019:     What can be perceived as \u2018friendly\u2019 and \u2018courteous\u2019 can be vague and subjective, and so to avoid that these clauses were simplified.</li> <li>Changed reference to the prohibition of phones to the prohibition of photography in changing rooms:     I looked into the origin of that clause in the templates I used, and the reason behind this clause was that the use of cameras in changing rooms, especially when involving minors, can be a very serious criminal offence.     There was a historic case we were advised about as part of the safeguarding officer training where this was an issue.     The language was very broad as a catch-all, but I recognise that phone bans are harder to enforce, especially when people use phones for all manner of things that are part of the session or match like timekeeping, taking notes, managing health-related data, etc.     I think it\u2019s best to make this very precise and make it about a ban on photography in changing rooms to cover the base more accurately.</li> <li>Deleted references to players choosing whom to be coached by:     The template I took this from was for an individual sport, and this clause does not work with team sports</li> </ol> <p>This changelog is for information only in order to clarify the differences between drafts, and will be removed prior to final publication.</p>"},{"location":"codes/clubs/","title":"Code of Conduct for Affiliated Clubs","text":"<p>The Scottish Korfball Association recognises that all affiliated clubs play a significant part in the leadership and organisation of korfball at the local level.
