# SKA Documents Hub (Beta)

Welcome to the beta test for the Documents Hub for the Scottish Korfball Association.
The Documents Hub is intended to be a searchable portal that hosts all governing documents, as well as relevant rules, regulations and procedures, of the SKA in an accessible format.

This is currently a beta test for the Documents Hub, and the documents hosted here are to be considered as drafts.
They will not be in effect until formally adopted by the governing bodies of the SKA.
