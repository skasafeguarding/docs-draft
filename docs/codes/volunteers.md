# Code of Conduct for General Volunteers and Committee Members

This code is for all volunteers involved in the running of the Scottish Korfball Association (excluding coaches or officials), such as club and SKA committee members or officers.
It sets out the rights of all such volunteers in the SKA as well as their responsibilities towards the wider community.

The SKA recognises that volunteers play an integral role in the running of Scottish korfball, and as such are the lifeblood of the community.
The SKA is committed to supporting all all volunteers so that they can carry out their role in a safe and positive environment, and expects that they likewise play their part in ensuring that the community remains as such.
Our goal is to emphasise personal integrity and accountability to the wider community, based on everyone involved understanding their rights as well as their responsibilities toward each other.

## My Rights as a Volunteer

As a volunteer in the SKA, I have the right to:

1. Carry out my role safely, free from abuse or harm by players, coaches, spectators, team managers, officials, or other volunteers, and not be left vulnerable.
2. Be treated with dignity and respect by teams, coaches, spectators, and all others involved.
3. Respect and fair treatment in the community and within all of its activities and processes.
4. Ask for and get appropriate help and support, including referrals to professionals.
5. Protection from abuse, harm, or discrimination by others in a way that respects my autonomy and agency.
6. Be believed, supported, and listened to when I experience or witness harm or abuse.
7. Report issues and concerns without fear of victimisation or reprisal.

Where I feel that my rights have been violated or not been upheld, I can raise this with the relevant officers of the SKA.
I can also discuss such concerns with the SKA Safeguarding Officer.

## My Responsibilities as a Volunteer

I recognise that as a volunteer, I am frequently going to be in positions of power, responsibility, and authority within the community.
In order to carry out my role with integrity and responsibility towards others, I will:

1. Respect the rights and dignity of all other participants within korfball, including players, officials, coaches, team managers, other volunteers, and spectators, and treat everyone equally.
2. Where my role requires me to work with people under 18 years of age or those considered at risk, I will ensure that I have appropriate criminal record and/or PVG checks.
3. Take responsibility for knowing and abiding by all relevant and governing rules, by-laws, and guidelines, including those by the International Korfball Federation and the SKA.
4. Disclose any conflicts of interest that may arise in my work.
5. Work in a spirit of cooperation with other volunteers and participants, and not interfere with their responsibilities.
6. Set a good example for members of the wider community in how to engage within the korfball community.
7. Cooperate fully with others involved in the sport, such as players, coaches, officials, team managers, medical personnel, other volunteers, and representatives of governing bodies, in the best interest of the community and the development of the sport.
8. Participate within the democratic and governance structures of my club and the SKA, and support all participants in having their voice heard in the running of the sport.
9. Develop relationships with other participants in korfball based on mutual trust and respect, especially those who are under 18 years of age or considered at risk.
10. Never use my position as a volunteer or committee member to exert undue influence on participants to obtain personal benefit or reward, or to incite or engage in sexual activity or inappropriate touching or communication (in person, on social media, or through any other form of verbal or non-verbal communication) with any participant.
11. Consistently promote positive aspects of the sport such as fair play, and never condone rule violations or the use of prohibited or substances.
12. Refrain from abusive or harmful behaviour towards others, whether it is physical, verbal, emotional, written, in person, or on-line.
13. Be fair and impartial in the way I carry out my duties.
14. Anticipate, and be responsible for, my own needs when carrying out the duties and tasks assigned to me, including being organised, punctual, and diligent.

Where my conduct does not meet the standards set in this code or where my actions may violate the rights of others, members of the community will hold me accountable, and may require me to apologise for and improve my conduct, or even to step away from my my role until any harm I may have caused is addressed.
I will not be able to continue my role, or in some cases participate in korfball as a whole, unless my conduct is of the required standard.

Where my conduct causes harm to participants under 18 years of age or participants who are considered at risk, this may be referred to statutory agencies or public authorities.
