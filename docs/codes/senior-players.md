# Code of Conduct for Senior Players

This code is for all participants in the Scottish Korfball Association who are above 18 years of age and are participating in korfball at any level.
It sets out the rights of all players in the SKA as well as their responsibilities towards the wider community.

The SKA is committed to creating a culture that nurtures the enjoyment and enthusiasm of every player within our community by creating a safe and positive environment.
Our goal is to emphasise personal integrity and accountability to the wider community, based on everyone involved understanding their rights as well as their responsibilities toward each other.

## My Rights as a Player

As a player in the SKA, I have the right to:

1. Be safe and happy while taking part in korfball, and be in an environment that supports my physical and mental well-being.
2. Respect and fair treatment in the community and within all of its activities and processes.
3. Participate in a welcoming sporting community, free from discrimination, bullying, and harassment.
4. Be supported in my development as a player and be coached by people with appropriate qualifications.
5. Respect and care from coaches, officials, and other participants, especially those who are in positions of power or trust.
6. Ask for and get appropriate help and support, including referrals to professionals.
7. Protection from abuse, harm, or discrimination by others in a way that respects my autonomy and agency.
8. Be believed, supported, and listened to when I experience or witness harm or abuse.
9. Report issues and concerns without fear of victimisation or reprisal.
10. An independent life outside of korfball, and my own boundaries on my time and participation.

Where I feel that my rights have been violated or not been upheld, I can raise this with relevant officers of my club or the SKA.
I can also discuss such concerns with the SKA Safeguarding Officer.

## My Responsibilities as a Player

In addition to recognising my rights above, as a responsible player, I will:

1. Respect the rights and dignity of all other participants, including fellow players, officials, coaches, team managers, volunteers, and spectators, and treat everyone equally.
2. Refrain from abusive or harmful behaviour towards others whether it is physical, verbal, emotional, written, in person or on-line.
3. Be respectful in my interactions with coaches, venue staff, officials, other players, parents, guardians, carers, team managers, volunteers, and spectators.
4. Take responsibility for knowing and abiding by all relevant and governing rules, by-laws, and guidelines, including those by the International Korfball Federation and the Scottish Korfball Association.
5. Participate fairly within the rules of korfball and respect decisions made by officials and coaches.
6. Set a good example for others, especially new and young players, and supporters, at all times in aspects of dress, punctuality, language, behaviour, and respect of facilities, equipment, and other people.
7. Not smoke or consume or be under the influence of alcohol or prohibited substances while competing or training.
8. Not misuse, abuse, or otherwise damage equipment, facilities, and venues.
9. Cooperate fully with others involved in the sport, such as coaches, officials, team managers, medical personnel, and representatives of governing bodies, in the best interest of myself and the wider community.
10. Assist, where possible, in smooth running of matches, training, or other activities.
11. Anticipate, and be responsible for, my own needs, including being organised, having the appropriate equipment, being on time, and seeking necessary support.
12. Respect the rules and policies of my club and those of any facilities or venues used, and pay all fees and dues promptly.
13. Recognise my responsibility in keeping myself and the wider community safe, and report inappropriate behaviour or risky situations to the appropriate Club or SKA officers.

Where my conduct does not meet the standards set in this code or where my actions may violate the rights of others, members of the community will hold me accountable, and may require me to apologise for and improve my conduct, or even to step away from my club, team, or the sport until any harm I may have caused is addressed.
I will not be able to continue participating in korfball unless my conduct is of the required standard.
