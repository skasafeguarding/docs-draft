# Code of Conduct for the National Team

As a member for the National Team, I recognise that this is an honour and privilege that brings with it additional responsibilities.
My actions and behaviour, both positive and negative, will reflect on the sport as well as the wider korfball community in Scotland.
Because of this, I will strive for the highest standards of conduct that is fitting for an ambassador of the Scottish Korfball Association.

In addition to abiding by the SKA Codes of Conduct that are relevant to my roles on the team, as a member of the National Team, I will also:

1. Always act the best interest of the SKA, and not act in any manner, whether on- or off-court, that is improper or brings the National Team, the SKA, or the wider community into disrepute.
2. Show the level of commitment to training and competitions that is expected of me as a member of the National Team.
3. Anticipate, and be responsible for, my own needs, including carrying any medication or equipment I may require to competitions, and notifying the management team of any medical issues or needs.
4. Follow best practice, and comply with guidance from the team managers, on matters concerning transport and accommodation to ensure the safety and well-being of the squad during trips away.
5. Play within the rules of the sport and follow the rules and regulations of the relevant competition.
6. Respect officials and their decisions, as well as all my opponents, fellow members of my squad, and my coach and management team.
7. Refrain from excessive drinking or consuming any prohibited substances, as well as any inappropriate conduct due to being inebriated or under the influence.
8. When competitions extend over a number of days, refrain from drinking until after the competition has concluded.
9. Refrain from smoking at training or at match venues, and never smoke in public while wearing SKA kit or clothing.
10. Respect the property of the SKA, including the training and match kit, and take responsibility for their replacement or repair when lost or damaged.
11. Abide by the guidance of the team managers regarding appropriate attire.
12. Cooperate with the team managers and the Management Committee on administrative and financial matters, including making appropriate transport arrangements, turning in itemised accounts for expenses promptly, and keeping any costs incurred within agreed budgets.
13. Always abide by governing policies of the SKA, especially the Anti-Doping Regulations.

I recognise that I may only be part of the national team as long as my conduct is of the highest standard expected.
