# Code of Conduct for Spectators and Supporters

This code is for all spectators and supporters who attend competitions or activities organised by the SKA, or that the SKA participates in, and covers all such events.
The SKA is dedicated to ensuring that all participants play the sport in a nurturing and positive environment, and thus relies on spectators and supporters to give their support in the right way.
By attending any such event, spectators and supporters agree to be bound by this code.

All spectators must:

1. Refrain from abusive or harmful behaviour towards others, whether it is physical, verbal, emotional, written, in person, or on-line.
2. Be respectful in their interactions with players, coaches, venue staff, officials, parents, guardians, or carers, team managers, volunteers, and other spectators.
3. Respect the decisions of officials and coaches.
4. Encourage all participants of their team or club by applauding their effort.
5. Applaud and recognise the efforts of all participants and teams for their efforts, not just their own.
6. Refrain from demeaning and insulting conduct, especially such conduct directed towards teams or players that made mistakes or did not win.
7. Abide by the SKA policies and guidelines on photography, consent, and the use of social media.
8. Support all efforts to mitigate and prevent bullying and other harmful and abusive conduct from all activities.

Where a spectator or supporter's conduct does not meet the standards set in this code or where their actions may violate the rights of others, members of the community will hold them accountable, and may require them to apologise for and improve their conduct, or even to leave the venue until any harm they may have caused is addressed.
In some cases, they may be barred from attending future events unless their conduct is of the required standard.
