# Code of Conduct for Affiliated Clubs

The Scottish Korfball Association recognises that all affiliated clubs play a significant part in the leadership and organisation of korfball at the local level.
This brings with it responsibilities towards the wider community for the safeguarding of participants and the fostering of a positive culture within the sport.
The SKA thus expects affiliated clubs to meet the standards set below.
It is the responsibility of the officers of each affiliated club to ensure compliance with and implementation of this code.

All affiliated clubs within the SKA must:

1. Adopt and comply with the relevant safeguarding policies of the SKA, and ensure that members are properly signposted to them[^1].
2. Comply with the SKA Procedures for Responding to Safeguarding Concerns[^2].
3. Adopt the various Codes of Conduct and ensure that all players, coaches, officials, volunteers, parents, guardians, carers, spectators, and supporters have read and accepted the relevant codes.
4. Implement, to the best of its ability, all SKA guidelines for good practice[^3].
5. Have in place procedures for responding to safeguarding concerns, as well as allegations of harm, abuse, misconduct, poor practice, or breaches of relevant codes and policies.
6. Appoint a minimum of one Safeguarding Officer or equivalent, with a remit and role description in line with the SKA Guidelines for Club Safeguarding Officers.
7. Ensure that all coaches and volunteers are recruited safely and operating appropriately within the Club environment, including (but not restricted to):
    - Holding appropriate and up-to-date licenses and/or qualifications,
    - Having undertaken satisfactory criminal records and/or PVG checks, and
    - Adhering to the terms of their qualification, guidelines on good practice, and the relevant policies and codes of conduct.
8. Ensure that coaches and club officers attend recommended safeguarding training every three years.
9. Adopt an induction process for new members that:
    - Includes agreeing and signing up to the relevant codes of conduct,
    - Signposts them to the safeguarding policies and procedures within the SKA, and
    - Provides them with the key contacts for raising safeguarding concerns within their club and in the SKA.
10. Participate proactively and in good faith with democratic processes and governance structures within the SKA, ensuring that all club members can have their voice heard in the running of the sport.
11. Cooperate fully with officials and representatives of the governing body in the best interests of the sport and the wider community.
12. Liaise appropriately with parents, guardians, and/or carers, officials, coaches, the SKA, and other relevant people or organisations to ensure that good practice is maintained.
13. Maintain a register of safeguarding training attended and criminal record and/or PVG checks completed for appropriate club members, and share this register with the SKA when asked.
14. Ensure that contact details for club safeguarding officers (or equivalent), the SKA Safeguarding Officer, and other relevant agencies or bodies are openly displayed and made readily available to anyone who requires them.
15. Ensure that club officers and volunteers act responsibly and set a good example for others, especially younger members.
16. Respect the rights, dignity and worth of every club member and others involved in korfball.
17. Develop an environment that promotes the well-being and safety of all participants above other considerations, including the development of performance.
18. Consistently promote positive aspects of the sport, such as fair play, cooperation, and gender equality, and never condone rule violations, misconduct, or the use of prohibited or age-inappropriate substances.
19. Accept that office bearers and committee members have a responsibility for safeguarding all participants, especially those who may be vulnerable such as young people or adults in adverse circumstances.
20. Promote an environment where concerns can be raised without fear of victimisation or reprisal.

The SKA will, to the best of its ability and available resources, support clubs in meeting the standards set out in this code.
