# Code of Conduct for Junior Players

This code is for all participants in the Scottish Korfball Association who are below 18 years of age and are participating in korfball at any level.
It sets out the rights of all junior players in the SKA as well as their responsibilities towards the wider community.

The SKA is committed to creating a culture that nurtures the enjoyment and enthusiasm of every player within our community by creating a safe and positive environment.
Our goal is to emphasise personal integrity and accountability within the community, based on everyone involved understanding their rights as well as their responsibilities toward each other.

## My Rights as a Player

As a player in the SKA, I have the right to:

1. Be safe and happy while taking part in korfball, and be in an environment that supports my physical and mental well-being.
2. Respect and fair treatment in the community and within all of its activities and processes.
3. Participate in a welcoming sporting community, free from discrimination, bullying, and harassment.
4. Be supported in my development as a player and be coached by people with appropriate qualifications.
5. Respect and care from coaches, officials, and other participants, especially those who are in positions of power or trust.
6. Ask for and get appropriate help and support, including referrals to professionals.
7. Protection from abuse, harm, or discrimination by others in a way that respects my autonomy and agency.
8. Be believed, supported, and listened to when I experience or witness harm or abuse.
9. Report issues and concerns without fear of victimisation or reprisal.
10. An independent life outside of korfball, and my own boundaries on my time and participation.

Where I feel that my rights have been violated or not been upheld, I can raise this with relevant officers of my club or the SKA.
I can also discuss such concerns with the SKA Safeguarding Officer.

## My Responsibilities as a Player

In addition to recognising my rights above, as a responsible player, I will:

1. Respect the rights and dignity of all other participants, including fellow players, officials, coaches, team managers, volunteers, and spectators, and treat everyone equally.
2. Refrain from bullying anyone or pressuring them to do things they do not want to do, in person or on-line.
3. Be respectful in my interactions with coaches, venue staff, officials, other players, parents, guardians, carers, team managers, volunteers, and spectators.
4. In no way undermine, put down, or belittle other players, coaches, or participants.
5. Refrain from any inappropriate or illegal behaviour.
6. Participate fairly within the rules of korfball and respect decisions made by officials and coaches.
7. Respect the rules of my club and the SKA.
8. Listen to instructions from my coach or officials.
9. Tell my coach if I am ill or injured.
10. Take care of equipment provided by my the SKA, my club, or the venue.
11. Report inappropriate behaviour or risky situations to an adult.
12. Not smoke or consume or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal substances.
13. Keep to agreed timings for all activities.
14. Tell my parents, guardians, or carers where I am or if I am going to be late.
15. Use safe transport and travel arrangements.
16. Refrain from photography or any form of video recording in toilets or changing rooms.

Where my conduct does not meet the standards set in this code or where my actions may violate the rights of others, members of the community will hold me accountable, and may require me to apologise for and improve my conduct, or even to step away from my club, team, or the sport until any harm I may have caused is addressed.
I will not be able to continue participating in korfball unless my conduct is of the required standard.
