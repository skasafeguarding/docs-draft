# Code of Conduct for Coaches

This code is for all coaches in the Scottish Korfball Association.
It sets out the rights of all coaches in the SKA as well as their responsibilities towards the wider community.

The SKA is committed to ensuring that all coaches are able to carry out their role in a safe and positive environment, and that they likewise play their part in ensuring all matches, training, and other activities remain as such.
Our goal is to emphasise personal integrity and accountability to the wider community, based on everyone involved understanding their rights as well as their responsibilities toward each other.

## My Rights as a Coach

As a coach in the SKA, I have the right to:

1. Carry out my role safely, free from abuse or harm by players, other coaches, spectators, team managers, volunteers, or officials, and not be left vulnerable.
2. Be treated with dignity and respect by teams, other coaches, spectators, officials, and all others involved.
3. Respect and fair treatment in the community and within all of its activities and processes.
4. Support in the development of my skills as a coach and access to ongoing training and information on all aspects of my role.
5. Support in completing the relevant qualifications and PVG checks that are required in order for me to carry out my role.
6. Ask for and get appropriate help and support, including referrals to professionals.
7. Protection from abuse, harm, or discrimination by others in a way that respects my autonomy and agency.
8. Be believed, supported, and listened to when I experience or witness harm or abuse.
9. Report issues and concerns without fear of victimisation or reprisal.

Where I feel that my rights have been violated or not been upheld, I can raise this with the relevant officers of the SKA.
I can also discuss such concerns with the SKA Safeguarding Officer.

## My Responsibilities as a Coach

In order to be an effective coach who helps the development of players and improving their performance, I must:

1. Identify and meet the needs of individuals and teams,
2. Improve performance through a programme of safe, guided practice, measured performance, and/or competition, and
3. Create an environment in which individuals are motivated to maintain participation and improve performance.

Furthermore, I also recognise that I am in a position of power and trust over the players I work with, and thus have a duty of care towards them.
I have the following responsibilities towards the wider community to follow good ethical practice:

### Safety and Well-Being of Participants

In order to ensure that everybody is safe in the activities I organise, I will:

1. Be prepared with an appropriate action plan in the event of emergencies.

3. Only provide First Aid or any treatment if I am properly qualified to do so.
4. Have emergency contacts for all participants.
5. Be prepared to call emergency services when needed.
6. Be aware of any medical conditions or allergies players may have.
7. Be aware if an player needs to take any regular medication, and discuss any relevant instructions with the player or, where appropriate, their parent, guardian, or carer.
8. Respect the autonomy, privacy, and dignity of the players in the event of any emergency.

### Integrity as a Coach

In order to support the development of players to the expected standard, I will:

1. Hold and abide by the terms of appropriate and valid qualifications relevant to my role, keep my knowledge and skills up to date, and renew these qualifications as required by the SKA.
2. Ensure that I have appropriate criminal record and/or PVG checks.
3. Take responsibility for knowing and abiding by all relevant and governing rules, by-laws, and guidelines, including those by the International Korfball Federation and the SKA.

6. Be aware of and abide by current national and international anti-doping regulations in sport, and not condone or be complicit in any contravening of such regulations.
7. Work in a spirit of cooperation with other coaches, and not undermine or interfere with them in any way, especially in situations where players may be working with more than one coach.
8. When demonstrating a technique through physical contact, always provide an explanation and seek consent before touching the players, and never touch a player under 18 years of age without another adult being present.
9. Promptly report any accidental injury or distress to relevant clubs and/or the SKA officers.
10. Challenge and report any inappropriate behaviour, suspected misconduct, harm, or abuse by officials, other coaches, or other people involved to relevant officers of the involved clubs and the SKA as soon as possible.

### Standards of Personal Conduct

In order to ensure that my conduct is respectful and trustworthy, I will:

1. Anticipate, and be responsible for, my own needs when carrying out the coaching duties assigned to me, including being organised, punctual, and having the appropriate equipment.
2. Consistently promote positive aspects of the sport such as fair play, and never condone rule violations or the use of prohibited or substances.
3. Never engage in the massage of any participant under 18 years of, and to never engage in the massage of a participant above 18 years of age without the relevant qualifications from a recognised body.

9. Not smoke or consume or be under the influence of alcohol or prohibited substances while undertaking any officiating duties.
10. Act ethically, professionally, and with integrity, and take responsibility for my actions.

### Respecting Rights and Dignities

In order to safeguard the well-being and rights of all participants, I will:

1. Respect the rights and dignity of all other participants within korfball, including players, officials, other coaches, team managers, volunteers, and spectators, and treat everyone equally.
2. Provide coaching without discriminating based on any characteristics of individual participants.
3. Make the health, safety, and welfare of the players I work with my primary and overriding concern.
4. Respect the rights of players to an independent life outside of korfball, and the personal boundaries they place on their time and participation.
5. In no way undermine, put down, or belittle officials, participants, or other coaches.
6. Seek to mitigate conflict where possible, and prevent disagreements from escalating.

### Maintaining Healthy Relationships and Boundaries

1. Clarify with players and, where appropriate, parents, guardians, and/or carers, what is expected of them and what they can expect of me.
2. Cooperate fully with others involved in the sport, such as officials, team managers, other coaches, medical personnel, and representatives of the governing body in the best interests of players and the wider community.
3. Develop relationships with other participants in korfball based on mutual trust and respect, especially those who are under 18 years of age or considered at risk.
4. Never incite or engage in sexual activity or inappropriate touching or communication (in person, on social media, or through any other form of verbal or non-verbal communication) with any participant under 18 years of age or are considered at risk.
5. Never use my position as a coach to exert undue influence on participants to obtain personal benefit or reward, or to incite or engage in sexual activity or inappropriate touching or communication (in person, on social media, or through any other form of verbal or non-verbal communication) with any participant.
6. Avoid behaviour or conduct that could compromise the safety or well-being of any players who are under 18 years of age or are considered at risk, such as, where I am not their parent, guardian, or carer:

    - spending time alone with them unless in clear view of other adults,
    - taking them alone in my vehicle,
    - inviting them alone into my home, or
    - sharing a bedroom with them.

Where my conduct does not meet the standards set in this code or where my actions may violate the rights of others, members of the community will hold me accountable, and may require me to apologise for and improve my conduct, or even to step away from my role as a coach until any harm I may have caused is addressed.
I will not be able to continue coaching, or in some cases participate in korfball as a whole, unless my conduct is of the required standard.

Where my conduct causes harm to participants under 18 years of age or participants who are considered at risk, this may be referred to statutory agencies or public authorities.
