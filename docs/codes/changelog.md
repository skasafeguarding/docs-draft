# Changelog

Following extensive consultation with member clubs of the SKA, the following changes and updates were made to the draft in response to the feedback received:

1. Removed references to the right to privacy in the codes for players:
    This is covered under data protection already and does not need to be a safeguarding code of conduct issue.
2. Removed clause in player codes of conduct regarding commitment to training:
    This was taken from a template of an SGB for a sport that had a much higher level of competition, and could be too demanding a clause for recreational players in the SKA.
3. Removed references to 'friendly' and 'courteous' in conduct expectations, and changed it to 'respectful':
    What can be perceived as 'friendly' and 'courteous' can be vague and subjective, and so to avoid that these clauses were simplified.
4. Changed reference to the prohibition of phones to the prohibition of photography in changing rooms:
    I looked into the origin of that clause in the templates I used, and the reason behind this clause was that the use of cameras in changing rooms, especially when involving minors, can be a very serious criminal offence.
    There was a historic case we were advised about as part of the safeguarding officer training where this was an issue.
    The language was very broad as a catch-all, but I recognise that phone bans are harder to enforce, especially when people use phones for all manner of things that are part of the session or match like timekeeping, taking notes, managing health-related data, etc.
    I think it's best to make this very precise and make it about a ban on photography in changing rooms to cover the base more accurately.
5. Deleted references to players choosing whom to be coached by:
    The template I took this from was for an individual sport, and this clause does not work with team sports
