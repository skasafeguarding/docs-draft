# Code of Conduct for Officials and Referees

This code is for all officials, such as technical officials, referees, and shot clock operators, in the Scottish Korfball Association.
It sets out the rights of all officials in the SKA as well as their responsibilities towards the wider community.

The SKA is committed to ensuring that all officials are able to carry out their role in a safe and positive environment, and that they likewise play their part in ensuring that all matches remain as such.
Our goal is to emphasise personal integrity and accountability to the wider community, based on everyone involved understanding their rights as well as their responsibilities toward each other.

## My Rights as an Official

As an official in the SKA, I have the right to:

1. Carry out my role safely, free from abuse or harm by players, coaches, spectators, team managers, volunteers, or other officials, and not be left vulnerable.
2. Be treated with dignity and respect by teams, coaches, spectators, and all others involved.
3. As a referee, use match disciplinary measures, such as issuing cards and/or barring participants from venues, in response to any abuse, harassment, misconduct, or harm.
4. Respect and fair treatment in the community and within all of its activities and processes.
5. Support in the development of my skills as an official and access to ongoing training and information on all aspects of my role.
6. Ask for and get appropriate help and support, including referrals to professionals.
7. Protection from abuse, harm, or discrimination by others in a way that respects my autonomy and agency.
8. Be believed, supported, and listened to when I experience or witness harm or abuse.
9. Report issues and concerns without fear of victimisation or reprisal.

Where I feel that my rights have been violated or not been upheld, I can raise this with the relevant officers of the SKA.
I can also discuss such concerns with the SKA Safeguarding Officer.

## My Responsibilities as an Official

As an official, I have the following responsibilities towards the wider community:

### Integrity as an Official

In order to carry out my role as an official to the expected standard, I will:

1. Hold appropriate and valid qualifications relevant to my role, keep my knowledge and skills up to date, and renew these qualifications as required by the SKA.
2. Take responsibility for knowing and abiding by all relevant and governing rules, by-laws, and guidelines, including those by the International Korfball Federation and the SKA.
3. Disclose any conflicts of interest that may arise in my involvement as an official.
4. Work in a spirit of cooperation with other officials and not interfere with their responsibilities.
5. Offer guidance and support to less experienced officials whenever appropriate.
6. Promptly report any accidental injury or distress to relevant clubs and/or the SKA officers.
7. Challenge and report any inappropriate behaviour, suspected misconduct, harm, or abuse by other officials, coaches, or other people involved to relevant officers of the involved clubs and the SKA as soon as possible.

### Standards of Personal Conduct

In order to ensure that my conduct is respectful and trustworthy, I will:

1. Anticipate, and be responsible for, my own needs when carrying out the officiating tasks assigned to me, including being organised, punctual, and having the appropriate equipment.
2. Consistently promote positive aspects of the sport such as fair play, and never condone rule violations or the use of prohibited or substances.
3. Refrain from abusive or harmful behaviour towards others, whether it is physical, verbal, emotional, written, in person, or on-line.
4. Be respectful in my interactions with players, coaches, venue staff, other officials, parents, guardians, carers, team managers, volunteers, and spectators.
5. Be fair and impartial in the way I carry out my duties.
6. Set a good example for others at all times in aspects of dress, punctuality, language, behaviour, and respect of facilities, equipment, and other people.
7. Not smoke or consume or be under the influence of alcohol or prohibited substances while undertaking any officiating duties.

### Respecting Rights and Dignities

In order to safeguard the well-being and rights of all participants, I will:

1. Respect the rights and dignity of all other participants within korfball, including players, other officials, coaches, team managers, volunteers, and spectators, and treat everyone equally.
2. Carry out my duties in accordance with the rules and with due respect for the rights and welfare of all those involved.
3. In no way undermine, put down, or belittle other officials, participants, or coaches.
4. Seek to mitigate conflict where possible, and prevent disagreements from escalating.
5. Ensure the welfare and safety of all participants while carrying out my duties.

### Maintaining Healthy Relationships and Boundaries

In order to foster respectful and healthy relationships with all participants, I will:

1. Clarify with players, coaches, and, where appropriate, parents, guardians, and/or carers, what is expected of them and what they can expect of me.
2. Cooperate fully with others involved in the sport, such as players, coaches, other officials, team managers, medical personnel, and representatives of governing bodies, in the provision of fair and equitable conditions for competitions.
3. Develop relationships with other participants in korfball based on mutual trust and respect, especially those who are under 18 years of age or considered at risk.
4. Never incite or engage in sexual activity or inappropriate touching or communication (in person, on social media, or through any other form of verbal or non-verbal communication) with any participant under 18 years of age or are considered at risk.
5. Never use my position as an official to exert undue influence on participants to obtain personal benefit or reward, or to incite or engage in sexual activity or inappropriate touching or communication (in person, on social media, or through any other form of verbal or non-verbal communication) with any participant.
6. Avoid behaviour or conduct that could compromise the safety or well-being of any players who are under 18 years of age or are considered at risk, such as, where I am not their parent, guardian, or carer:  
    - spending time alone with them unless in clear view of other adults,
    - taking them alone in my vehicle,
    - inviting them alone into my home, or
    - sharing a bedroom with them.

Where my conduct does not meet the standards set in this code or where my actions may violate the rights of others, members of the community will hold me accountable, and may require me to apologise for and improve my conduct, or even to step away from my role as an official until any harm I may have caused is addressed.
I will not be able to continue being an official, or in some cases participate in korfball as a whole, unless my conduct is of the required standard.

Where my conduct causes harm to participants under 18 years of age or participants who are considered at risk, this may be referred to statutory agencies or public authorities.
