## About these Codes

The Scottish Korfball Association recognises that all members of the Scottish korfball community share a responsibility in safeguarding its members and creating a safe and transparent environment.
The purpose of these codes is to foster a culture of mutual respect and personal integrity through an understanding of all participants' rights within as well as responsibilities towards the wider community[^1].
These codes clarify what behaviours are acceptable and unacceptable, the standard of practice expected, and the basis for challenging and improving behaviours or practice.

## Scope

The Codes of Conduct are divided into individual codes for different categories of stakeholders within Scottish korfball.
This includes codes of conduct for:

1\. [Affiliated Clubs](clubs.md)  
2\. [Senior Players](senior-players.md)  
3\. [Junior Players](junior-players.md)  
4\. [Coaches](coaches.md)  
5\. [Officials and Referees](officials.md)  
6\. [General Volunteers and Committee Members](volunteers.md)  
7\. [Parents, Guardians, and/or Carers](guardians.md)  
8\. [Spectators and Supporters](spectators.md)  
Appendix: [The National Team](national-team.md)

The SKA requires that any individual involved in Scottish korfball at any level and in any capacity must read, agree to, and comply with the code of conduct that is relevant to their role.
Where an individual is involved in more than one capacity --- such as a player who is also a coach, or a match official who is also an officer of the SKA --- they must have agreed to all relevant codes for each of their roles, and must abide by the appropriate when performing any specific role.

Where participants represent Scotland or the SKA as part of the National Team, they will be required to abide by the relevant appendix to the Codes of Conduct in addition to codes that already govern them.
No one code shall supersede the other.

Additionally, the SKA recognises that affiliated clubs play a big part in leadership and organisation of korfball at the local level.
The SKA believes that this brings with it considerable responsibility towards the safeguarding of participants within Scottish korfball, and so requires all clubs and their leadership to abide by the relevant code of conduct for affiliated clubs.

Codes of Conduct 4, 5, and 6 only apply to Coaches, Officials and Referees, and General Volunteers and Committee Members who are adults.
Where a participant in korfball under the age of 18 is involved in any capacity other than as a player, such as as an official, coach, or volunteer, the SKA will follow the protocols given below regarding participants under the age of 18.

## Codes of Conduct for Under-18 Participants

### Players Under the Age of 18

Players who are under the age of 18 must abide by the [code of conduct for Junior Players](./junior-players.md).
These codes must be accepted by both the young player as well as a designated responsible adult as appropriate.

### Roles other than Players

The SKA believes that it is beneficial for young athletes to have the opportunity to participate in the leadership, coaching, and organising of a sport, and will support young participants as well as parents, guardians, or carers in their development.
However, the SKA recognises that there are complexities within existing safeguarding legislation regarding standards of conduct where a person under the age of 18 is involved in a position of leadership or authority within a sport.
Because this, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to safeguarding, and as such the SKA would need to adopt a careful and considered approach that takes the specifics of individual circumstances into consideration.

Where there is a participant under the age of 18 involved within Scottish korfball in any capacity other than as a player, such as in coaching, officiating, or otherwise volunteering or being part of a committee, the SKA will approach this on a case-by-case basis.
Relevant officers of the SKA will work with the participant as well as a designated responsible adult to draft a code of conduct specific to the individual, their role, and circumstances.
In doing so, the SKA will pay close attention to safeguarding risks that may arise as a result of conflicts of interest in the young participant's involvement, as well as any positions of power that can affect their relationships with their peers.
