# Code of Conduct for Parents, Guardians, and/or Carers

This code is for all parents, guardians, and/or carers of those participants in the Scottish Korfball Association who are under 18 years of age, or those participants who may be considered at risk.
It sets out the rights of all parents, guardians, and carers as well as their responsibilities towards the wider community.

The SKA is committed to supporting, empowering, and reassuring parents, guardians, and/or carers that the people in their care are able to participate in korfball safely.
Our goal is to emphasise personal integrity and accountability to the wider community, based on everyone involved understanding their rights as well as their responsibilities toward each other.

## My Rights as a Parent, Guardian, and/or Carer

1. Be treated with dignity and respect by teams, coaches, spectators, and all others involved.
2. Protection from abuse, harm, or discrimination by others in a way that respects my autonomy and agency.
3. Be assured that the person in my care is safe and protected during their participation in korfball.
4. Be informed of any problems that concern or relate to the person in my care.
5. Be informed if the person in my care is injured or unwell.
6. Have my consent sought for relevant matters such as trips away or photography.
7. Contribute to decisions within the community.
8. Ask for and get appropriate help and support, including referrals to professionals.
9. Have any concerns about any aspects of the welfare and safety of the person in my care listened and responded to.
10. Report issues and concerns without fear of victimisation or reprisal.

Where I feel that my rights, or the rights of the person in my care, have been violated or not been upheld, I can raise this with the relevant officers of the SKA.
I can also discuss such concerns with the SKA Safeguarding Officer.

## My responsibilities as a Parent, Guardian, and/or Carer

As a parent, guardian, and/or carer, I have the following responsibilities:

### Supporting the Person in my Care

In order to ensure the safety, enjoyment, and well-being of the person in my care, I will:

Encouraging them to have fun, and never force them to participate if they don't want to.
Ensuring that they are adequately prepared for the activity they are participating in, and are supported in any needs they may have.
Be responsible for their safe transportation to and from activities, and know where they are and whom they are with at all times.
Never condone rule violations or the use of prohibited substances.
Encourage them to respect the rules and recognise the value of hard work and not just results.
Ensure that they understand their relevant codes of conduct, as well as the governing rules, guidelines, by-laws, policies, and practices of the club, the SKA, and the IKF.
Motivate them to do their best and uphold the sporting values of fairness, gender equality, cooperation, and mutual respect away from the sport as well as when they are engaged in it.
Help them understand the important life lessons to be gained from the sport, such as equality, leadership, handling adversity, teamwork, persistence, and compassion.
Establish a positive relationship with their coach, team managers, and other officers of the club and the SKA.
Never ridicule, shout at, berate, belittle, or in any way undermine them.
Check the qualifications and licences of people who are coaching, managing, or providing care for them.
Report any concerns about their or any other person's safety or well-being to relevant officers of the club or the SKA, or to public authorities if I feel it is necessary.

### Supporting the SKA and the Club

In order to allow the coaches, team managers, officers, or other volunteers of the SKA and the club to carry out their roles and keep the person in my care safe, I will:

1. Work together with the person in my care, the coaches, and other officers or volunteers in devising and implementing a plan for their participation in all activities, including transport and support for any medical needs.
2. Complete and return any required forms and documents pertaining to the participation, medical information, and related permissions of the person in my care.
3. Report any changes to participation, transport, or other arrangements concerning safety and well-being as soon as possible before the person in my care next takes part in a session.
4. Deliver and collect the person in my care punctually before and after any activities, and inform relevant coaches and organisers prior to the activity starting if they are to be collected early.
5. Support the SKA and the club by attending events and activities where I can.
6. Abide by governing rules, policies, guidelines, by-laws, and codes of practice of the club and the SKA.

### Supporting the Wider Community

In order to ensure a culture where everyone takes responsibility for the safety and well-being of the wider community, I will:

1. Refrain from abusive or harmful behaviour towards others, whether it is physical, verbal, emotional, written, in person, or on-line.
2. Be respectful in my interactions with players, coaches, venue staff, officials, other parents, guardians, or carers, team managers, volunteers, and spectators.
3, Behave responsibly and set a good example for all participants.
4. Encourage, respect, and applaud the efforts of all members of the community, and not just the person in my care and their team.
5. Show understanding and compassion where players do not win or perform as well as expected.
6. Be positive and discuss performance in a constructive manner, focussing on what players did well rather than dwelling on mistakes.
7. Support all efforts to mitigate and prevent bullying and other harmful and abusive conduct from all activities.

Where my conduct does not meet the standards set in this code or where my actions may violate the rights of others, members of the community will hold me accountable, and may require me to apologise for and improve my conduct, or even to step away from attending activities until any harm I may have caused is addressed.
I will not be able to attend games, competitions, or other events unless my conduct is of the required standard.

I also recognise that, in some cases, my conduct and its consequences may affect the ability of the person in my care to participate in korfball, and so it is especially important that I do my best to ensure that I abide by this code.
