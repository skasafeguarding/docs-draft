!!! quote "Definition"

    The SKA understands safeguarding to mean the protection of all participants from harm of any kind, and the ensuring of a safe and transparent environment for all participants within the sport.
    The SKA further recognises that that some groups --- such as children or adults in adverse circumstances --- are at greater risk of harm.
    The SKA thus also has a specific duty to support individuals who may be considered at risk or otherwise unable to safeguard their own rights or interests.

The SKA also believes that the safeguarding and welfare of all participants are responsibilities shared by the whole community.

For more information regarding the background, scope, and context of the SKA's responsibilities within governing legislation and policy, please consult the [detailed overview of the Safeguarding Framework](framework.md).

> **If you are concerned that you or any other member of the community may be at risk of harm, you must report it.**

## Reporting Safeguarding Concerns

If you are concerned that anybody --- whether it is yourself or any other person --- has experienced or is likely to experience any form of harm, you can report this via email to the named contacts below.
All concerns will be taken seriously and will be recorded.

Any of the information reported will be confidential and relevant members of the SKA Management Committee and/or Board will only be informed on a strictly need-to-know basis.
