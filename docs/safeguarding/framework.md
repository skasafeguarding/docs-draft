The Scottish Korfball Association is committed to safeguarding the welfare of all participants.
The SKA's definition of safeguarding can be found in the [Safeguarding Statement](index.md).

The SKA recognises that safeguarding is defined differently in different contexts, and carries different levels of duties and responsibilities.
This policy statement outlines the SKA's approach to safeguarding in line with governing legislation in Scotland and in the United Kingdom, as well as guidelines issued by relevant sport governing bodies and public authorities.

## Background

1. The International Olympic Committee's definition of safeguarding concerns the protection of all participants in sport from any form of harassment and abuse[^1].
  The SKA interprets its remit of safeguarding along the lines of the IOC's definition as encompassing all participants in Scottish korfball and all forms of harassment and abuse.
2. Additionally, in the United Kingdom and in Scotland, legislation, statutory guidance, and public bodies on safeguarding are specifically concerned with the support and protection of children and adults who may be considered at risk of harm or otherwise unable to safeguard their own rights or interests[^2].
  From such governing legislation and policy, where there is a risk of harm to children or at-risk adults, the SKA has additional duties towards safeguarding as well as specific legal duties of disclosure, data protection, and referral to relevant authorities.
3. The International Korfball Federation has further adopted a Safeguarding Framework for member nations to abide by.
  The SKA will review its safeguarding framework in line with guidance issued by the IKF.
4. The SKA acknowledges that the rights and legal protections of children differ from that of adults, and that they come under the remit of different public agencies[^3].
  In implementing its framework for safeguarding, the SKA thus requires different policies for the protection of children and adults.

## Scope

1. The Safeguarding Framework of the SKA applies to all activities and events of the Scottish Korfball Association as well as to all clubs that are affiliated with the SKA.
2. All clubs shall be expected to comply with the Safeguarding Framework, abide by the relevant policies and guidelines, implement safeguarding protocols at the local level, and cooperate with the SKA in all matters concerning the safeguarding of participants in Scottish korfball.

## The SKA Safeguarding Framework

The Scottish Korfball Association recognises that safeguarding cannot be achieved by a single policy or process, but requires a much wider change within the culture.
This is why the SKA's approach to safeguarding involves a much broader framework of various policies, procedures, resources, collective action, and community organising.

!!! Info "SKA Safeguarding Framework and Interim Measures"

    The SKA is currently in the process of developing its safeguarding framework.
    Until the SKA has its own framework in place, it shall be using policies and procedures adopted by [England Korfball](https://englandkorfball.co.uk/home/about-us/safeguarding/), with necessary adaptations in order to suit the scale and management structures of the SKA.
    
    The SKA is also awaiting the issuance of formal guidance on safeguarding by the IKF.

    In order to ensure the integrity of its safeguarding processes, the SKA will consult relevant public bodies concerning safeguarding in sport in all of its interim procedures.
